        3.7 was released on October 28, 2014 with the following features and bug fixes:\r\n\r\n*
        simplified configuration: use ENV variables and consolidate configuration
        for Rails, Capistrano, Chef and Vagrant into a single `.env` file. See below
        for more information ([#146](https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto/issues/146))\r\n*
        raise alert on the admin status page if not running the latest Lagotto version.
        This feature checks for the [latest release in the Lagotto Github repo](https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto/releases)
        using pessimistic version constraints, e.g. `\"~> 3.6.3\"` ([#155](https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto/issues/155))\r\n*
        facelift of the admin panel layout ([#156](https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto/issues/156))\r\n*
        adapted to changes in the Facebook API ([#90](https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto/issues/90)).
        Lagotto now automatically\r\n  fetches the authentication token from a given
        `app_key` and `app_secret`. Since the release of the v2.1 API in August 2014
        the **link_stat** API endpoint is depreciated. New user accounts have to use
        the v2.1 API and only get the total count of Facebook activity, whereas users
        will older API keys can still use the **link_stat** API and get the number
        of shares, comments and likes in addition to the total count by adding the
        following `link_stat URL` in the Facebook configuration:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nhttps://graph.facebook.com/fql?access_token=%{access_token}&q=select
        url, share_count, like_count, comment_count, click_count, total_count from
        link_stat where url = ''%{query_url}''\r\n```\r\n\r\n* don''t cache in Rails
        development mode ([#157](https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto/issues/157))\r\n*
        many small bug fixes ([#147](https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto/issues/147),

        with the Lagotto 3.7 release all user-specific configuration options for Rails,
        as well as for the server configuration and deployment tools Vagrant, Chef
        and Capistrano are environment variables, and can be stored in a single `.env`
        file. An example file is provided (`.env.example`) and can be used without
        modifications for a development server. More information regarding ENV variables
        and `.env` is available [here](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv). The following

        3.4 was released on August 22, 2014 with the following new features:\r\n\r\n*
        better caching of the admin panel\r\n* simplified admin panel navigation,
        and more information made available to regular users\r\n* publisher model
        with support for automated article import via CrossRef API\r\n* more granular

        API for admin users\r\n* new `/heartbeat` API endpoint to check application
        health\r\n* many bug fixes\r\n\r\nTo enable the automated daily article import
        via CrossRef API, add the following line to `config/settings.yml`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nimport:
        member\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo import articles manually, leave import empty; or use
        one of the following options for automated daily import via cron:\r\n\r\n*
        `import: all`: All DOIs updated the last day\r\n* `import: sample`: A random
        sample of 20 from all DOIs updated the last day\r\n* `import: member`: All
        DOIs from the publishers in the publisher admin interface, updated the last
        day\r\n* `import: member_sample`: A random sample of 20 from all DOIs from
        the publishers in the publisher admin interface, updated the last day\r\n\r\nPublishers
        can now be added in the admin interface. The only functionality is currently
        the automated article import described above.\r\n\r\nFor admin users alerts
        are now available via API, use the `/api/v4/alerts` endpoint and basic authentication.
        More details in the API documentation.\r\n\r\nThere is one configuration change
        in error reporting: the `disabled_source_report` has been renamed to `fatal_error_report`,
        as an immediate email will now be sent for all errors with severity `FATAL`.
        To rename the report template in the database, run this rake task once (using
        the appropriate `RAILS_ENV`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nbundle exec rake mailer:rename_report
