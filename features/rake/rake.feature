#   I should be able to run rake tasks
# 
#   Scenario: rake is installed
#     When I run `bundle exec rake --version`
#     Then the output should contain "rake, version"
#     
#   Scenario Outline: rake tasks exist
#     When I run `bundle exec rake -T`
#     Then the output should contain "<Task>"
#     And the output should contain "<Description>"
#
