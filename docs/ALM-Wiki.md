The Ruby on Rails application Article-Level Metrics (ALM) was started in March 2009 by the [Public Library of Science (PLOS)](http://www.plos.org/), a large non-profit open access publisher. It allows a user to aggregate relevant performance data on research articles including online usage, citations, and altmetrics. We’re continuing to expand the Article-Level Metrics application because we believe that articles should be considered on their own merits, and that the impact of an individual article should not be determined by the journal in which it happened to be published. As a result, we hope that new ways of measuring and evaluating research quality (or ‘impact’) can and will evolve.

We hope that Article-Level Metrics will become a powerful and transparent way of measuring the impact that individual articles have on the scientific and the wider community.
