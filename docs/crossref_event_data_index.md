# Early Preview: This service is under development.

This is a preview site to enable you to browse the Event Data that weâ€™re collecting. We will be developing it into a full service.

Please look around and explore our interim display of the raw data. At launch in the second half of 2016, we will provide formal mechanisms to view and access this data.

Each publication in this system is displayed as a 'work.' Browse event data for the external platform of interest based on Source or Works. Event activity is displayed for each work in the Relations tab. The Results tab displays a summary visualization based on the date in which the system received the data.

Please visit [eventdata.crossref.org](http://eventdata.crossref.org) for full information, including technical documentation or [contact us](mailto:eventdata@crossref.org) directly with your questions and feedback.
